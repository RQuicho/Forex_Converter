### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What are important differences between Python and JavaScript?
  Python runs on servers (not in browser). Used for data science, machine learning, making server, etc. Syntax is cleaner and easier to read. Can express concepts at a high level.
  JavaScript can be used for front-end and back-end. 

- Given a dictionary like ``{"a": 1, "b": 2}``: , list two ways you
  can try to get a missing key (like "c") *without* your programming
  crashing.
  1. print (dict.get("c", "Key not found"))
  2. print dict.setdefault("c", "Key not found")


- What is a unit test?
  Testing code in isolated small peices. Tests one "unit" of functionality (i.e. a function or method).

- What is an integration test?
  Tests that components work together. These are written with unittest framework.

- What is the role of web application framework, like Flask?
  Set of functions, calsses, etc. that help define:
    - which requests to respond to (URL)
    - how to respond to requests (what function does when URL is reached)
  Like a library, but bigger.

- You can pass information to Flask either as a parameter in a route URL
  (like '/foods/pretzel') or using a URL query param (like
  'foods?type=pretzel'). How might you choose which one is a better fit
  for an application?
  Using a parameter in a route URL directs user to another "location." Path params are used to identify a specific resource/resources. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30967822/when-do-i-use-path-params-vs-query-params-in-a-restful-api)
  Using a URL qurey param is usually used for forms or user input. Query params are used to sort/filter those resources. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30967822/when-do-i-use-path-params-vs-query-params-in-a-restful-api)

- How do you collect data from a URL placeholder parameter using Flask?
  request.form["name"]

- How do you collect data from the query string using Flask?
  request.args("name")

- How do you collect data from the body of the request using Flask?
  Use a GET and POST requests.

- What is a cookie and what kinds of things are they commonly used for?
  Cookies are name/string-value pairs sorted by the client(browser). The server tells client to store these. The client sends cookies to the server. (https://lessons.springboard.com/Cookies-Sessions-6e7af9fe88a7434283ab367af51823aa)

- What is the session object in Flask?
  Contains infor for the current browser, preserve type (lists stay as lists), are "signed" so users can't modify data. (https://lessons.springboard.com/Cookies-Sessions-6e7af9fe88a7434283ab367af51823aa)

- What does Flask's `jsonify()` do?
  Changes data into JSON format.
